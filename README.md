# Drums Kit Javascript project

This project gives us a simple implementation of Javascript on a html file where we created a virtual drum kit with sounds of different instruments. Whenever we click a particular instrument's block it will play the sound of that particular instrument.
## Procedure to use:
 1. Download the zip file
 2. Extract it
 3. Open the HTML file in the browser
 4. Enjoy the drum beats
